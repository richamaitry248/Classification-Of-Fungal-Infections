# Classification-Of-Fungal-Infections
A CNN-based hybrid classification model that combines ResNet50 and DenseNet121 to identify and differentiate between fungal infections such as Onychomycosis, Tinea Nigra, and Tinea Corporis. This project focuses on classical  CNN concepts , integrating feature extraction from both architectures to improve classification accuracy.
